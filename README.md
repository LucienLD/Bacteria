# Bacterial pattern formation
Bacterial pattern formation can be modeled using reaction-diffusion systems. These systems describe how the concentration of one or more substances  distributed in space changes under the influence of two processes: local chemical reactions and diffusion.
Spatial patterns which are formed by some kinds of bacterial colonies present an interesting structure during their growth
conditions. In particular, colonies of bacterium bacillus can present a rich variety of structures,and the nature
of the pattern exhibited depends on the particular bacterial species used and the environmental conditions 


## Work conducted :
- Studied the origin of the reaction-diffusion model for Bacterial Pattern Formation and defined the parameters.
- Performed numerical simulations of the reaction-diffusion equations;
- Analyzed the resulting patterns and compared them with experimental former results.
